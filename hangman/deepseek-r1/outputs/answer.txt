To solve this problem, we need to create a Hangman game where the user guesses a movie name based on a given clue. The game should provide feedback for each guess, display a hangman animation for incorrect attempts, and proceed to a new game after each round, whether the user wins or loses.

Approach
Game Setup: Randomly select a movie and its corresponding clue from a predefined list.

User Interaction: Display the clue and the current state of the guessed word, which starts with underscores for each letter.

Guess Handling: Validate user input to ensure it's a single alphabetic character. Track guessed letters and update the game state based on correct or incorrect guesses.

Hangman Animation: Display progressive stages of a hangman drawing for each incorrect guess.

Game Termination: End the round when the user either guesses all letters correctly or exhausts all attempts. Proceed to a new game automatically.

Explanation
Constants: HANGMAN_STAGES contains ASCII art for each hangman stage, and MOVIES holds movie names and clues.

HangmanGame Class: Manages game state, including the movie, clue, guessed letters, remaining attempts, and the revealed word.

Game Loop: The play method handles the game loop, displaying clues, hangman stages, and processing user input.

Input Validation: Ensures the user inputs a single alphabetic character and handles repeated guesses.

Win/Loss Check: Determines if the user has won by guessing all letters or lost by exhausting attempts, then proceeds to a new game.

This solution efficiently encapsulates game logic within a class, ensuring modularity and readability while adhering to Python best practices for a high pylint score.
