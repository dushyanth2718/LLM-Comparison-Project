Okay, I need to create a Hangman game in Python that meets the user's requirements. Let's start by breaking down the requirements.

First, the game should randomly generate a clue for a movie name. Then the user has to guess the movie based on that clue. Each wrong guess leads to a hangman animation. If the user guesses correctly, congratulate them and move to the next game. Also, the code needs to have a pylint score above 8, so I should follow good coding practices and style guidelines.

Let's start with the data structure. I need a list of movies along with their clues. Maybe a list of dictionaries where each dictionary has a 'movie' and 'clue' key. That way, I can randomly pick one for each game.

Next, the hangman animation. I remember that each wrong attempt adds a part to the hangman. So there should be a list of strings representing each stage. Each time the user makes a wrong guess, the stage increases, and the corresponding ASCII art is displayed. I'll need to define these stages properly.

The game loop should handle the following steps: display the clue, show the current state of guessed letters, prompt for a guess, check if the guess is correct, update the displayed word, and manage the hangman's progress. Also, after each guess, check if the word is completely guessed (win) or if the hangman is fully drawn (lose).

Handling user input is important. The user should input a single letter. I need to validate that input—ensure it's a single character and a letter, not a number or symbol. Also, check if the letter has already been guessed to avoid repetition.

Now, structuring the code. Maybe create a class for the Hangman game to encapsulate the state. The class can have attributes like the current movie, the clue, the guessed letters, the number of attempts left, etc. Methods could include generating a new game, processing a guess, checking for win/lose conditions, and displaying the current state.

Wait, but the user didn't mention using OOP. However, using a class might make the code cleaner and more organized, which is good for pylint score. Alternatively, functions could be used with parameters. Let's think: if using functions, passing around the game state might get messy. A class would encapsulate it better. So, probably a class-based approach.

The main loop would be something like:

1. Select a random movie and clue.

2. Display the clue.

3. Initialize the game state (hidden word, guessed letters, attempts left).

4. While the game is not over:

a. Display the hangman art based on attempts left.

b. Display the current progress of the guessed word (e.g., _ _ _ _ for letters not yet guessed).

c. Prompt the user for a guess.

d. Validate the input.

e. Check if the guess is correct.

f. Update the game state accordingly.

g. Check for win or loss.

5. If the user wins, congratulate and start a new game. If they lose, reveal the answer and proceed.

For the movie and clue data, I'll hardcode a list for simplicity. For example:

movies = [

{'movie': 'Inception', 'clue': 'Dream within a dream'},

...

]

But in a real scenario, maybe reading from a file would be better. However, the user didn't specify external files, so hardcoding is acceptable here.

Now, the hangman stages. Each wrong guess (up to 6, maybe) adds a part. I'll create a list where each element is a string representing the hangman's state. The stages can be built step by step with ASCII art.

Regarding the code structure:

- Imports: Need random for selecting the movie, and perhaps sys for exiting, but maybe not necessary.

Wait, the user wants the game to proceed to the next game upon winning. So after a game ends (win or lose), it should restart automatically. So the main loop could be a while loop that runs indefinitely, starting a new game each time.

Wait, the user says "proceed to the next game"—so after a correct guess, congratulate and move to next. But if they lose, perhaps reveal the answer and then proceed. So the loop should continue, generating a new movie each time.

So, the flow would be: play a game, then ask if the user wants to play again? Or automatically start a new game? The user's point 4 says "proceed to the next game" upon correct guess. So maybe after each game, whether win or lose, it starts a new one. But the user might want to exit. Hmm, the original requirements don't mention an exit condition. Maybe the game runs indefinitely until the user interrupts it. Or perhaps after each game, it asks to continue. But the user's point 4 says "proceed to the next game" upon correct guess. So perhaps after a win, it proceeds automatically. But if they lose, maybe the same? Or does it always proceed? The requirement isn't clear. Let me check again.

The fourth requirement: "If the user guesses the movie name correctly, congratulate and proceed to the next game." So upon correct guess, proceed. What if the user fails? The requirement doesn't specify, but the third point says that for every failed attempt, the animation happens. So upon failure (all attempts used), the game should probably end that round, show the answer, and proceed to the next game.

So each game is one movie. Whether the user wins or loses, the game proceeds to the next one. So the code would loop, each iteration being a new game. So the main loop is infinite, each iteration picks a new movie, plays the game, and then loops again.

But how to handle that? Because after a game ends (win or lose), the next iteration starts, selecting a new movie. But maybe the user wants to stop. The requirements don't mention an exit, but perhaps the game runs until interrupted. However, for the code, perhaps the user can press Ctrl+C to exit. Or maybe after each game, it asks if the user wants to play again. But the requirements don't mention that. Hmm. The user's fourth point says to proceed to the next game upon correct guess, but it's unclear about incorrect. But maybe the intended behavior is that after each game (win or lose), a new game starts. So the code would loop infinitely, each time selecting a new movie.

But maybe the user wants to have the option to exit. However, since the requirements don't specify, perhaps the code can proceed automatically to the next game each time. So the main loop is while True: play a game.

Now, coding the game steps.

First, select a random movie and clue. Then display the clue. The user has to guess the movie name. So the hidden word is the movie name. The user guesses letters. Each incorrect guess adds to the hangman. The maximum number of allowed incorrect guesses is the number of stages minus one. For example, if there are 6 stages (0 to 5), then 6 incorrect guesses allowed.

So the Hangman class (if using OOP) would have:

- selected_movie: the current movie to guess.

- clue: the clue for the movie.

- guessed_letters: a set of letters the user has guessed.

- correct_letters: letters in the movie name.

- attempts_left: starts at 6, perhaps.

But maybe the movie name is in uppercase, and we compare case-insensitively. So we can convert the movie name to uppercase, and user inputs are converted to uppercase as well.

The display word would show underscores for letters not guessed yet, and the letters where guessed. For example, if the movie is "Inception", and the user guessed 'I' and 'N', it would show "I N _ _ _ _ _ _ _".

So, the steps for each game:

1. Pick a random movie and clue.

2. Display the clue.

3. Initialize the game state: guessed_letters as empty set, attempts_left as 6 (assuming 6 stages).

4. While True:

a. Display the hangman art based on attempts_left.

b. Display the current word progress.

c. If all letters are guessed, congratulate and break loop (proceed to next game).

d. If attempts_left is 0, show game over, reveal the movie, and break loop.

e. Get user input for a letter.

f. Check if input is valid (single alphabetic character, not already guessed).

g. If valid, add to guessed_letters.

h. If the letter is in the movie name, check if all letters are now guessed.

i. If not in the movie name, decrease attempts_left.

j. Check if attempts_left is 0.

Now, the hangman animation. Each stage is displayed when attempts_left decreases. So the stages list should be ordered from 0 attempts left (full hangman) to 6 attempts left (no hangman). Wait, maybe the number of stages is 7, from 0 to 6, where 6 is the initial state (no parts drawn), and 0 is the full hangman. Wait, no. Let's think: when the user has 6 attempts left, they start with 6, and each wrong guess reduces it. So for 6 wrong guesses allowed, there are 7 possible stages (including 0). So the stages list would have 7 elements. For example:

HANGMAN_STAGES = [

# stage when 0 attempts left (all parts drawn)

"""

--------

|      |

|      O

|     \\|/

|      |

|     / \\

-

""",

# stage when 1 attempt left (one part missing)

...,

# and so on until stage 6, which is empty

]

But constructing these ASCII arts can be time-consuming. Need to make sure each stage adds a part. Let me think of a standard hangman stages. The typical order is:

1. The gallows (base, pole, beam)

2. Head

3. Body

4. Left arm

5. Right arm

6. Left leg

7. Right leg

So for 6 wrong guesses allowed, there are 6 stages (from 1 to 6 parts), but the initial stage (no parts) is shown before any wrong guesses. Wait, maybe I should structure the stages as a list where each index corresponds to the number of wrong guesses. For example, after 0 wrong guesses, show the first stage (just the gallows), then after each wrong guess, show the next stage. Wait, no. Let's think again. Let me check the standard hangman steps.

Standard hangman has the following progression:

- Initial: no parts

- Wrong guess 1: head

- Wrong guess 2: body

- Wrong guess 3: left arm

- Wrong guess 4: right arm

- Wrong guess 5: left leg

- Wrong guess 6: right leg → game over.

So that's 6 wrong guesses leading to 7 stages (including the initial). Wait, no. The initial stage (no parts) is before any wrong guesses. Each wrong guess adds a part. So if allowed 6 wrong guesses, there are 7 stages (0-6).

So for the HANGMAN_STAGES list, there will be 7 elements. The first element (index 0) is the initial stage (no body parts), and each subsequent index adds a part. Wait, no: actually, the first wrong guess (after 1 wrong) shows the head (stage 1), then stage 2 adds the body, etc. So the stages list should be ordered from 0 (no parts) up to 6 (full hangman). Each wrong guess increments the stage. So the number of allowed wrong guesses is 6, leading to 7 stages. So the stages list is of length 7.

Let me create these stages. Let's write them step by step.

Stage 0 (0 wrong guesses):

+---+

|   |

|

|

|

|

=========

Stage 1 (head added):

+---+

|   |

O   |

|

|

|

=========

Stage 2 (body):

+---+

|   |

O   |

|   |

|

|

=========

Stage 3 (left arm):

+---+

|   |

O   |

/|   |

|

|

=========

Stage 4 (right arm):

+---+

|   |

O   |

/|\  |

|

|

=========

Stage 5 (left leg):

+---+

|   |

O   |

/|\  |

/    |

|

=========

Stage 6 (right leg, game over):

+---+

|   |

O   |

/|\  |

/ \  |

|

=========

So each stage corresponds to the number of wrong guesses. So HANGMAN_STAGES[6] is the final stage.

So in code, this list will be written as a list of multi-line strings. Each time the user makes a wrong guess, the stage increases, and the corresponding art is displayed.

Now, coding this.

Next, the movie and clues. Let's create a list like:

MOVIES = [

{"movie": "INCEPTION", "clue": "Dream within a dream"},

{"movie": "TITANIC", "clue": "Ship that sank on its maiden voyage"},

# ... more entries

]

But the user may need to have more entries, but for the example, a few should suffice.

Now, the main game loop. Let's outline the code structure.

First, import necessary modules:

import random

Then, define the HANGMAN_STAGES and MOVIES.

Then, create a HangmanGame class. The class will have:

- Attributes:

- movie: the current movie to guess (uppercase)

- clue: the clue for the movie

- guessed_letters: a set of letters the user has guessed

- max_attempts: 6

- remaining_attempts: starts at max_attempts

- revealed_word: a list that shows the letters guessed correctly, else underscores

Methods:

- __init__: initializes the game with a movie and clue

- display_clue: prints the clue

- display_status: shows the hangman stage, revealed word, and guessed letters

- guess_letter: processes a letter guess

- is_game_over: checks if the user has won or lost

- play: runs the game loop

Alternatively, perhaps functions without a class. Let's think: for pylint score, classes are better if the code is structured properly. But perhaps a class-based approach is manageable.

Alternatively, using functions, passing the game state as a dictionary.

But considering the need for a high pylint score, using a class may help in organizing the code better.

So, the HangmanGame class:

class HangmanGame:

def __init__(self, movie, clue):

self.movie = movie.upper()

self.clue = clue

self.guessed_letters = set()

self.max_attempts = 6

self.remaining_attempts = self.max_attempts

self.revealed_word = ['_' if c.isalpha() else c for c in self.movie]

def display_clue(self):

print(f"Clue: {self.clue}")

def display_hangman(self):

print(HANGMAN_STAGES[self.max_attempts - self.remaining_attempts])

def display_revealed_word(self):

print(' '.join(self.revealed_word))

def guess_letter(self, letter):

letter = letter.upper()

if letter in self.guessed_letters:

print("You already guessed that letter.")

return False

self.guessed_letters.add(letter)

if letter in self.movie:

# Update revealed_word

for i, c in enumerate(self.movie):

if c == letter:

self.revealed_word[i] = letter

return True

else:

self.remaining_attempts -= 1

return False

def is_win(self):

return '_' not in self.revealed_word

def is_game_over(self):

return self.is_win() or self.remaining_attempts <= 0

Then, the main loop would create a new HangmanGame instance for each movie, and manage the user input and game flow.

But wait, the main function would loop over each movie, creating a new game each time.

Wait, the user's first requirement is to randomly generate a clue for a movie name. So each game starts with selecting a random movie from the list.

So, in the main loop:

while True:

movie_info = random.choice(MOVIES)

game = HangmanGame(movie_info['movie'], movie_info['clue'])

game.play()

But wait, the play method would handle the game loop for that instance.

The play method would:

- Display the clue

- While the game is not over:

- Display hangman

- Display revealed word

- Get user input

- Process the guess

- Check if game over

Wait, the play method would be:

def play(self):

self.display_clue()

while not self.is_game_over():

self.display_hangman()

self.display_revealed_word()

letter = input("Guess a letter: ").strip().upper()

if len(letter) != 1 or not letter.isalpha():

print("Please enter a single alphabetic character.")

continue

if letter in self.guessed_letters:

print("You already guessed that letter.")

continue

self.guess_letter(letter)

# After game over

if self.is_win():

print("Congratulations! You guessed the movie!")

else:

print(f"Game over! The movie was: {self.movie}")

print("\nNext game...\n")

Wait, but the code should proceed to the next game automatically. So after the play method finishes, the loop continues.

But in this setup, each game runs, then the loop starts a new one.

Now, putting all together.

But first, the HANGMAN_STAGES. Need to define them as a list. Let's code them correctly.

HANGMAN_STAGES = [

"""

+---+

|   |

|

|

|

|

=========

""",

"""

+---+

|   |

O   |

|

|

|

=========

""",

"""

+---+

|   |

O   |

|   |

|

|

=========

""",

"""

+---+

|   |

O   |

/|   |

|

|

=========

""",

"""

+---+

|   |

O   |

/|\\  |

|

|

=========

""",

"""

+---+

|   |

O   |

/|\\  |

/    |

|

=========

""",

"""

+---+

|   |

O   |

/|\\  |

/ \\  |

|

=========

"""

]

Each stage corresponds to the number of wrong guesses. So for remaining_attempts = 6 (initial), the number of wrong guesses is 0, so stage 0. When remaining_attempts is 5, stage 1, etc. Wait, no. The stage index is calculated as (max_attempts - remaining_attempts). Since max_attempts is 6, and remaining_attempts starts at 6, initial stage is 0 (6-6=0). When remaining_attempts is 5, it's 6-5=1, so stage 1. So yes, in the display_hangman method, the index is self.max_attempts - self.remaining_attempts.

Now, testing the code.

But what if the movie has spaces or special characters? For example, "STAR WARS" would have a space. The revealed_word would show the space as is, because in the __init__ method, the revealed_word is built with '_' if the character is alphabetic, else the character itself.

Yes, the line:

self.revealed_word = ['_' if c.isalpha() else c for c in self.movie]

So spaces, apostrophes, etc., are shown as is.

Now, handling user input. The guess_letter method checks if the input is a single alphabetic character. The play method's loop handles input validation.

Now, checking for the win condition: when all letters are revealed (no underscores left in revealed_word).

Putting all together.

Wait, but in the play method, the loop runs while not self.is_game_over(). So inside the loop, it displays the hangman, revealed word, then prompts for input. Then processes the guess. Then, when the loop exits, it checks for win or lose.

Now, possible issues: the hangman stages may have leading/trailing whitespace. The print statements for the stages may look a bit off. But for the purposes of the game, as long as each stage is displayed correctly, it's okay.

Another thing: when the user guesses a correct letter, the revealed_word is updated. The method returns True if correct, else False. But in the play method, the guess_letter is called, and if correct, the revealed_word is updated. Then, the loop continues.

Now, test case: movie is "INCEPTION". Clue is "Dream within a dream".

User guesses 'I' → revealed_word becomes I _ _ _ ... etc.

Now, code should handle uppercase inputs, but the user can enter lowercase, which is converted to uppercase.

Now, code for the main loop.

But wait, in the code, after creating a game instance, the play method is called. So the main loop is:

def main():

while True:

movie_info = random.choice(MOVIES)

game = HangmanGame(movie_info['movie'], movie_info['clue'])

game.play()

But the play method includes the game loop for that particular movie.

Now, putting all this into code.

Now, checking for pylint. The code should have docstrings, proper naming conventions, etc.

The class name HangmanGame is in CamelCase, which is correct.

Method names are lowercase with underscores, which is correct.

Constants HANGMAN_STAGES and MOVIES are in uppercase.

Variables like movie_info are in snake_case.

So, the code should pass pylint with a score over 8.

Potential pylint issues: missing docstrings, line too long (in the HANGMAN_STAGES strings), but for the stages, line length is acceptable as they are multi-line strings.

Adding docstrings to the class and methods.

For example:

class HangmanGame:

"""A Hangman game instance for a specific movie."""

def __init__(self, movie, clue):

"""Initialize game with a movie and clue."""

# code here

Each method should have a docstring.

Also, the methods like guess_letter may need to have parameters and return values documented.

Another consideration: the HANGMAN_STAGES and MOVIES are constants, so they should be at the top of the module, after imports.

Putting all together, the code should look something like this:

import random

HANGMAN_STAGES = [

# ... stages as above

]

MOVIES = [

{"movie": "INCEPTION", "clue": "Dream within a dream"},

{"movie": "TITANIC", "clue": "Ship that sank on its maiden voyage"},

{"movie": "JURASSICPARK", "clue": "Dinosaur theme park disaster"},

{"movie": "AVATAR", "clue": "Blue aliens on a distant moon"},

{"movie": "MATRIX", "clue": "Virtual reality simulation"},

]

class HangmanGame:

"""A class representing a Hangman game session for a movie."""

def __init__(self, movie, clue):

"""Initialize a new game with the given movie and clue."""

self.movie = movie.upper()

self.clue = clue

self.guessed_letters = set()

self.max_attempts = 6

self.remaining_attempts = self.max_attempts

self.revealed_word = ['_' if c.isalpha() else c for c in self.movie]

def display_clue(self):

"""Display the clue for the current movie."""

print(f"Clue: {self.clue}")

def display_hangman(self):

"""Display the current state of the hangman based on remaining attempts."""

stage = self.max_attempts - self.remaining_attempts

print(HANGMAN_STAGES[stage])

def display_revealed_word(self):

"""Display the current state of the guessed movie with underscores and letters."""

print(' '.join(self.revealed_word))

def guess_letter(self, letter):

"""Process a guessed letter and update the game state accordingly."""

letter = letter.upper()

if letter in self.guessed_letters:

print("You already guessed that letter.")

return False

self.guessed_letters.add(letter)

if letter in self.movie:

for i, char in enumerate(self.movie):

if char == letter:

self.revealed_word[i] = letter

return True

self.remaining_attempts -= 1

return False

def is_win(self):

"""Check if the player has guessed all letters in the movie."""

return '_' not in self.revealed_word

def is_game_over(self):

"""Check if the game is over (win or loss)."""

return self.is_win() or self.remaining_attempts <= 0

def play(self):

"""Run the game loop for the current movie."""

self.display_clue()

while not self.is_game_over():

self.display_hangman()

self.display_revealed_word()

guess = input("Guess a letter: ").strip().upper()

if len(guess) != 1 or not guess.isalpha():

print("Please enter a single alphabetic character.")

continue

self.guess_letter(guess)

if self.is_win():

print("Congratulations! You've guessed the movie correctly!")

else:

print(f"Game over! The movie was: {self.movie}")

print("\nStarting next game...\n")

def main():

"""Main function to run the Hangman game indefinitely."""

while True:

movie_info = random.choice(MOVIES)

game = HangmanGame(movie_info["movie"], movie_info["clue"])

game.play()

if __name__ == "__main__":

main()

Now, checking for possible issues.

The HANGMAN_STAGES strings have proper indentation. In Python, the multi-line strings will preserve the indentation. But in the code above, the stages are written with leading spaces. When printed, they will appear correctly aligned.

Testing the code: when a user plays, the clue is displayed, then the hangman stage, then the revealed word. For each guess, it processes and updates.

Potential issues:

- The movie names in MOVIES may have spaces or special characters. For example, if a movie is "STAR WARS", the revealed_word would show spaces as is. But in the sample MOVIES list provided, the entries are all uppercase and without spaces. For example, "JURASSICPARK" is written as one word. Maybe the user should input the movie names in all caps and without spaces for simplicity. Alternatively, the code handles spaces, like if a movie is "STAR WARS", the revealed_word would be ['S', 'T', 'A', 'R', ' ', 'W', 'A', 'R', 'S'] with the space preserved.

But in the current code, any non-alphabetic character (like space or apostrophe) is displayed as is. So that's handled.

Another thing: in the MOVIES list, the movie names should match exactly. For example, if the movie is "The Matrix", then in the code it should be "THE MATRIX" (uppercase with space), and the code would display the space correctly.

But in the provided example, "MATRIX" is written as one word. So it depends on how the data is entered. The code is agnostic to that.

Now, the code uses 'movie_info = random.choice(MOVIES)', so each game selects a random movie from the list.

Now, pylint. Let's check possible issues.

- The HANGMAN_STAGES and MOVIES are constants, so their names are in uppercase. That's correct.

- Class and method docstrings are present.

- Method arguments: the guess_letter method takes 'letter' as a parameter.

- Line lengths: the HANGMAN_STAGES strings may have long lines, but they are in triple quotes and part of a list, so pylint will ignore line length there.

- Variables like 'char' in the loop are correctly named.

- The main function is defined, and the code runs when __name__ == '__main__'.

So the code should have a high pylint score.

Possible improvements: adding more movies to the MOVIES list, but the user can add as needed.

So this code should meet all the requirements.
