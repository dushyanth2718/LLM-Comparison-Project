Crafting the Hangman game

I’m developing a Hangman game in Python, featuring a random movie clue, automatic hangman animations for wrong guesses, and a scoring system that congratulates correctly guessed movies.

Crafting movie clues

I’m thinking through a dictionary of movie names and clues, like "Titanic" with "A ship sinks in the icy Atlantic ocean," or "Inception" with "A thief enters dreams to steal secrets."

Mapping out the game

I’m defining a main() function with a loop for selecting random movies and clues. Integrating interactive hangman logic, we’ll update states for each incorrect guess and manage spaces and punctuation.

Wondering about the format

I’m thinking letter-by-letter guesses work best, aligning with typical hangman gameplay. Each incorrect guess reveals a new hangman animation, making the game progress in a clear, exciting way.

Crafting the game flow

I’m mapping out selecting movies, initializing game states, managing hangman animations, and updating guesses. Checking if the movie name is guessed or if guesses exceed the limit ensures gameplay progression.

Mapping out game logic

I’m creating a play_hangman(movie, clue) function to manage each round, ensuring correct naming conventions, docstrings, and type annotations for cleaner, more understandable code.

Crafting hangman visuals

I’m assembling a list of multi-line strings to represent progressive hangman states. Each string uniquely illustrates the hangman drawing, adapted to the guessed character count.

Charting hangman stages

I’m outlining a sequence of hangman drawings to track incorrect guesses, ranging from 0 to 6. Repeated and non-alphabetic guesses are managed via a set of guessed letters.

Transforming input

I’m thinking through converting movie titles and clues to lowercase, revealing spaces, and using a list comprehension to update the display word with correct and hyphen characters.

Refining the script

I’m adding type annotations and docstrings, incorporating import statements, and establishing a hanger stage list. This paves the way for a comprehensive and intuitive script.

Starting the game

I’m planning a hangman game, detailing MOVIE_CLUES, setting up guessed_letters and wrong_guesses, and preparing to reveal the movie titles and clues.

Starting the game

I’m prompting the user to guess a letter, checking for validity and previous guesses, updating the movie display, and managing the win or loss states to ensure a full experience.
