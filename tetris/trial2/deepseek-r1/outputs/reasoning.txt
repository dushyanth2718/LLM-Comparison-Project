Okay, I need to write a Tetris game in Python. Let me start by recalling what Tetris involves. There are different shaped blocks called tetrominoes that fall from the top of the screen. The player moves and rotates them to create complete lines, which then disappear. The game ends when the blocks stack up to the top.

First, I should choose a library for graphics. Pygame is a popular choice for games in Python. I'll need to install it if I haven't already. The code will probably use Pygame's functions for drawing shapes, handling events, and managing the game loop.

Next, the game grid. Tetris uses a grid, usually 10 columns wide and 20 rows tall. Each cell can be filled or empty. I'll represent this with a 2D list, maybe with dimensions based on the grid size. The grid needs to track the positions of the landed pieces.

Then the shapes. There are seven tetrominoes: I, O, T, L, J, S, Z. Each has a specific shape and color. I can represent each shape as a list of lists, indicating the positions relative to the top-left corner when the piece is created. Colors can be predefined for each shape.

The piece movement: the current piece falls down, can be moved left/right, rotated, and dropped faster. Collision detection is crucial here. When moving or rotating, the code must check if the new position is within the grid and not overlapping with existing blocks.

Rotation is a bit tricky. Each piece has a rotation state, and when rotated, its shape changes. The code should handle the rotation by cycling through the possible shapes of the tetromino. Also, need to check if rotation is possible without causing collisions.

Scoring: when a line is completed, points are awarded. The game should check each row of the grid after a piece lands. If a row is completely filled, it's removed, and the rows above are shifted down. The score increases based on the number of lines cleared at once.

The game loop will handle events (key presses), update the game state (move the piece down at intervals), and redraw the screen. Pygame's clock can control the frame rate and the falling speed.

Handling user input: arrow keys for left/right movement, up for rotation, down for soft drop. The events in Pygame can capture these key presses and update the piece's position accordingly.

Drawing the grid and pieces: Each cell in the grid can be drawn as a rectangle. The current piece is drawn based on its position and shape. The next piece can be displayed in a separate area.

Game over occurs when a new piece cannot be placed at the top without colliding. So after locking a piece, check if any part of the new piece is out of bounds, which would mean the grid is filled up to the top.

Now, structuring the code. Start by initializing Pygame, setting up the window, colors, and the grid dimensions. Then define the shapes and their colors. Create a class for the Tetris game, which manages the grid, current piece, score, etc.

The main loop will run until the game is closed. Each iteration processes input, updates the game state, and redraws everything. The current piece falls at regular intervals. When it can't move down anymore, it's merged into the grid, lines are cleared, and a new piece is spawned.

Possible issues to consider: off-by-one errors in grid coordinates, correct rotation matrices for each shape, handling edge cases when rotating near walls or other blocks, and efficient line clearing.

Testing each component step by step would help. For example, check if moving left/right works, rotation doesn't cause clipping, lines are cleared properly, and the game over condition triggers correctly.

I think that's the general plan. Let me start coding this step by step.
