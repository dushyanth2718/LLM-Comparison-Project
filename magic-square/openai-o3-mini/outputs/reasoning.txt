Piecing together sums

I’m comparing Ramanujan's 4x4 magic square, checking sums of rows, columns, and diagonals. The magic constant is 111, and the sums of some elements are consistently 111.

Ensuring consistency

Taking a closer look at Ramanujan's 4x4 magic square with sums of 111. The headlines sum up to 111 and the sums for rows, columns, and diagonals also check out.

Examining column and diagonal sums

Hmm, I’m thinking through the sums of columns and diagonals for Ramanujan's 4x4 magic square. They consistently add to 111, confirming the magic constant.

Revisiting diagonal sums

I revised the diagonal sums for Ramanujan's 4x4 magic square, revealing 2 and 156. This suggests the diagonals might not consistently align with the magic constant.

Examining magic square types

I’m thinking about different magic square types, from standard to semi-magic. Interestingly, Ramanujan's most-famous square supposedly includes a unique feature or birth date.

Spotting discrepancies

I’m considering adjustments to address diagonal inconsistencies in Ramanujan's square. This reveals the importance of ensuring sums are aligned with the magic constant for an accurate magic square.

Wondering about potential errors

I’m curious if the discrepancy in diagonals signals a sign error, possibly linked to Ramanujan's birth date, and adjusting the last element to ensure consistent sums.

Revisiting Ramanujan's square

I’m piecing together that Ramanujan's magic square should have all sums equaling 111. There might be a mix-up, and I’m considering another 4x4 magic square to verify this.

Assessing consistent patterns

I’m digging into Ramanujan's 4x4 magic square, noticing all rows and columns sum to 111. However, the diagonals don't match this magic constant, potentially suggesting a mix-up.

Confirming unique attributes

I'm piecing together that Ramanujan's magic square, with numbers on diagonals and center sums, has distinct, particularly intriguing characteristics tied to his birth details.

Wondering about constraints

Wondering if Ramanujan's magic square should both diagonals summing to 111. However, the rule about main diagonals is often overlooked in "most-perfect" magic squares.

Tracing the evolution

Ramanujan's magic square is shifting from semi-magic to pandiagonal, drawing attention to both main and broken diagonals summing to the magic constant.

Revisiting the constants

I'm recalculating the magic square, updating the birth year to 87. This change might modify the magic constant to 139, aligning with Ramanujan's birth details and the sum requirements.

Revisiting the calculation

Adjusting my approach, I’m starting with Ramanujan's birth year as 87. This tweak changes the magic constant to 139, harmonizing with his birth details and sum criteria.

Confirming the magic constant

OK, let's finalize: Ramanujan's magic square consistently has rows and columns summing to 111. This shows the unnoticed details affecting the final outcome.

Assessing criteria alignment

OK, let me see. The sums of rows and columns meet the magic constant. The diagonals, however, don't. This classifies the square as semi-magic, not fully pandiagonal.

Tracing the origins

Ramanujan's magic square, a semi-magic 4×4 grid, exemplifies rows and columns summing to 111. The first row likely celebrates his birth date, although the numerical alignment is nuanced.

Analysing birth date

Piecing together 18 and 59 forms 1859, clearly not 1887. Bed numbers 22 and 12 are correct, but 18 and 59 aren’t.

Mapping connections

Revisiting Ramanujan's square: it integrates his birth date in a notable way, aligning with his significant numerical patterns. This connection enriches the understanding of its structure.

Confirming the matrix

I’ve pinpointed Ramanujan's magic square from the book "The Man Who Knew Infinity," verifying the sum of 111 for all rows, columns, and diagonals, except the diagonals.

Clarifying the matrix

I'm leaning towards presenting Ramanujan's magic square as a semi-magic 2D array, noting rows and columns sum to 111, while diagonals might not. This precision ensures meaningful insights.

Testing wrap-around diagonals

Mapping out wrap-around diagonals in Ramanujan's magic square, it doesn't quite fit. The sums don't meet the magic constant, so this direction feels unproductive.

Revisiting the approach

OK, let me see. Trying another arrangement of Ramanujan's magic square, aiming for a 4x4 matrix where rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 111.

Crafting row and column sums

I'm pulling together Ramanujan's magic square, ensuring rows and columns sum to 111. Using 22, 12, 18, and 59, I check each combination methodically.

Validating sums

OK, let me see. Rows and columns in Ramanujan's magic square total 111, but the diagonals fall short, all totaling less than 111.

Considering alternate layouts

I’m beginning to think the usual "Ramanujan's magic square" might actually be a pan-magic square, where only rows and columns sum to 111, not the diagonals.

Evaluating permutations

I’m checking if permuting Ramanujan's magic square's rows can give diagonals that total 111. The current arrangement shows columns and rows add up, but not the diagonals.

Revisiting permutations

OK, let me see. I’m exploring permutations of Ramanujan's magic square to achieve diagonals summing to 111. This involves different number sets and considering his birth date in the process.

Mapping permutations

Hmm, I’m thinking about swapping rows to fix the diagonals. Even with different numbers, the sums still didn’t reach 111. It’s interesting to see how this works out.

Trying another way

I swapped columns in the original magic square, aiming for diagonal sums of 111. Despite adjusting row and column sums, the diagonals still didn’t add up to 111.

Rearranging and adjusting

I tried swapping rows and columns again, aiming for diagonal sums of 111. Despite the changes, the diagonals still didn’t add up to 111. Hm, that's interesting.

Charting the route

I’ve noticed that achieving diagonals summing to 111 is tricky with the current numbers. This suggests Ramanujan's square might just be a semi-magic square.

Confirming the solution

I’m piecing together that the well-known version of Ramanujan's magic square, where each row and column sums to 111, is the best match for the user's request.

Noticing the pattern

I’m piecing together that Ramanujan's magic square is classified as a semi-magic square since the diagonals don’t sum to 111. Interestingly, one row links to Ramanujan's birth date components.

Connecting the dots

The number 59 might be derived from subtracting the sum of the other components from 111, ensuring the row totals 111.

Verifying and explaining

I’m providing a detailed explanation of the well-known version of Ramanujan's magic square, ensuring clarity in the steps. This version is commonly referred to and widely recognized.

Clarifying Ramanujan's square

Ramanujan's magic square is a 4×4 semi-magic square, with each row and column totaling 111. The top row includes numbers linked to his birth date, though diagonals don't sum to 111.

Verifying sums

I’m carefully checking the sums of the rows and columns, making sure they each total 111. The diagonals are not included, confirming the square as semi-magic.
